## Introduction to computer networks

- A **computer network** is a group of **devices** connected together, allowing the sharing of information and **resources**.

- There are two core types:
  - **Local Area Network (LAN)**: Small and covers a limited area.
  - **Wide Area Network (WAN)**: Similar to the internet, connecting schools and **businesses** worldwide.

- Networks are the foundation that allows communication between devices, enabling us to use the internet to watch movies, communicate, and browse the web.

- They allow us to share resources, such as printers or shared files at work.

- They support apps for **connectivity** and data transfer.

## Key Networking Components 

- ***Switches***
   - Connect **multiple** devices within the same network.
   - Manage data flow within a **LAN**.
   - Prevent congestion and ensure efficient communication.

- ***Routers*** 
   - Direct traffic between different networks.
   - Ensure data gets to the right place.
   - Connect different networks, such as your home network to the internet.

- ***Firewalls***
   - Protect networks.
   - Monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic.


## IP Addresses and MAC Addresses

- **IP**: Internet Protocol address
   - It's a unique identifier assigned to each **device** on a network.
   - It allows devices to locate and communicate with each other.
   - Two types: 
      - **IPv4**: `192.168.0.5`
         - The most common.
         - 32-bit address.
         - Written in decimal format.
         - Consists of 4 groups of numbers separated by dots.
         - Each group ranges from 0-255, providing around 4.3 billion addresses.
         - Due to the rapid growth of the internet, we're running out of IPv4 addresses.
         
      - **IPv6**: `2001:0db8:85a3:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334`
         - 128-bit numbers.
         - Written in hexadecimal format.
         - We need to transition to IPv6; it's essential for the growth of the internet.
         - IPv6 also includes enhancements like simplified address assignment and improved security features.


- **MAC**: Media Access Control address
   - A unique identifier assigned to a network interface.
   - Each **device** on a network has its own MAC address.
   - It's a 48-bit address, e.g., `00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E`, using a hexadecimal format.
   - MAC addresses operate at the **Data Link layer** of the OSI Model.

## Ports and Protocols

| **Protocol** | **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**                    | **UDP (User Datagram Protocol)**                |
|--------------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Type**     | Connection-oriented                                         | Connectionless                                |
| **Handshake**| Requires a handshake                                        | No prior communication needed                 |
| **Reliability**| Reliable data transfer                                    | Fast but less reliable                        |
| **Data Order**| Ensures data is delivered in order                         | No guarantee of data order                    |
| **Error Checking**| Has error-checking and flow control                     | No error-checking                             |
| **Use Case** | Suitable for any bidirectional communication                | Suitable for real-time applications where speed is more important than reliability |
| **Examples** | File transfer, web browsing                                | DNS, VPN                                      |



   
## OSI 7-Layer Model

*Open system Interconnection Modal*

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement standard networking protocols. Although not all networking software follows this exact model, it provides a strong foundation for networking principles.

<h4 align="center"><em>7 Layers Stacked on Top of Each Other</em></h4>


#### **Media Layer**

1. **[Physical Layer](./notes/physical-layer.md)**  
   - Deals with the physical hardware and transmission media (e.g., cables, switches).

2. **[Data Link Layer](./notes/data-link-layer.md)**  
   - Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and handling.

3. **[Network Layer](./notes/network-layer.md)**  
   - Manages routing of data between devices in different networks (e.g., IP addressing).

---

#### **Host Layer**

4. **[Transport Layer](./notes/transport-layer.md)**  
   - Ensures error-free data transmission between hosts and manages flow control (e.g., TCP/UDP).

5. **[Session Layer](./notes/session-layer.md)**  
   - Manages communication sessions, allowing setup, maintenance, and termination of connections.

6. **[Presentation Layer](./notes/presentation-layer.md)**  
   - Translates data between the application and the network, handling encryption, compression, and encoding.

7. **[Application Layer](./notes/application-layer.md)**  
   - Provides network services directly to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).


---

***They‚Äôre divided into two groupings***

- **Media layers**
    - Dealing with how data is moved between point A and point B, whether it's in the same local network or on opposite sides of the planet.
    
- **Host layers**
    - How the data is chopped up and reassembled for transport.
    - How it's formatted so it's understandable by both sides of a network connection.
