# Networking learning


### OSI 7-Layer Model

The OSI model is a conceptual framework used to understand and implement standard networking protocols. Although not all networking software follows this exact model, it provides a strong foundation for networking principles.

#### 7 Layers Stacked on Top of Each Other

---

#### **Media Layer**

1. **[Physical Layer](./notes/physical-layer.md)**  
   - Deals with the physical hardware and transmission media (e.g., cables, switches).

2. **[Data Link Layer](./notes/data-link-layer.md)**  
   - Responsible for node-to-node data transfer, error detection, and handling.

3. **[Network Layer](./notes/network-layer.md)**  
   - Manages routing of data between devices in different networks (e.g., IP addressing).

#### **Host Layer**

4. **[Transport Layer](./notes/transport-layer.md)**  
   - Ensures error-free data transmission between hosts and manages flow control (e.g., TCP/UDP).

5. **[Session Layer](./notes/session-layer.md)**  
   - Manages communication sessions, allowing setup, maintenance, and termination of connections.

6. **[Presentation Layer](./notes/presentation-layer.md)**  
   - Translates data between the application and the network, handling encryption, compression, and encoding.

7. **[Application Layer](./notes/application-layer.md)**  
   - Provides network services directly to applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP).
