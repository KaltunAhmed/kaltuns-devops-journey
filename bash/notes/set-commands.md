## `set` Commands in Bash

The `set` command in Bash allows you to configure the behavior of the shell. Below is a table describing the specific options `-e`, `-u`, `-x`, `-o nounset`, `-o errexit`, `-o pipefail`, and their combinations:

| Command          | Description                                                                                              | Example           |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| `set -e`         | Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status. This helps in stopping the script when an error occurs. | `set -e`          |
| `set -u`         | Treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately. This prevents the use of uninitialized variables. | `set -u`          |
| `set -x`         | Print commands and their arguments as they are executed. This is useful for debugging.                   | `set -x`          |
| `set -o nounset` | Same as `set -u`: Treat unset variables as an error and exit immediately.                              | `set -o nounset`  |
| `set -o errexit` | Same as `set -e`: Exit immediately if a command exits with a non-zero status.                          | `set -o errexit`  |
| `set -o pipefail`| Set the exit status of a pipeline to that of the rightmost command to exit with a non-zero status. This ensures that errors in pipelines are not ignored. | `set -o pipefail` |
| `set -eux`       | Combines `-e`, `-u`, and `-x` options. Exits on error, treats unset variables as errors, and prints each command before executing it. | `set -eux`        |
| `set -euxo pipefail` | Combines `-e`, `-u`, `-x`, and `-o pipefail` options. Exits on error, treats unset variables as errors, prints each command before executing it, and ensures that errors in pipelines are not ignored. | `set -euxo pipefail` |
