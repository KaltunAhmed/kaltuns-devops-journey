## Bash comparison operators 

In Bash, integer comparison operators are used within conditional expressions to compare numerical values. These operators allow you to perform comparisons such as checking if one number is equal to, greater than, or less than another number. They are used with the [[ ... ]] or [ ... ] syntax for conditional statements in scripts.

Here's a table outlining the common integer comparison operators:


| Operator | Description                | Example               |
|----------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| `-eq`    | Equal to                   | `[[ $a -eq $b ]]`     |
| `-ne`    | Not equal to               | `[[ $a -ne $b ]]`     |
| `-lt`    | Less than                  | `[[ $a -lt $b ]]`     |
| `-le`    | Less than or equal to      | `[[ $a -le $b ]]`     |
| `-gt`    | Greater than               | `[[ $a -gt $b ]]`     |
| `-ge`    | Greater than or equal to   | `[[ $a -ge $b ]]`     |
