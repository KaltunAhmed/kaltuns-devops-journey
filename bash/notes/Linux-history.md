## Brief history of Unix & Linux 

Unix Is an operating system created in the 1960’s by AT&T and Bell Labs.  Unix was enormously popular on the DEC PDP-11 series computers, these were the most common computers at the time before the rise of the microprocessor. However, Bell Labs wasn’t allowed to sell Unix software so they released it for free. The folks at Berkely built upon it and produced their own version of it called `BSD-Unix` . MacOS was built on top of the the `BSD-Unix`  variant of Unix OS. 

When the Personal computer (PC) started to become mainstream there were attempts to make a version of Unix for the PC. Linux was written by a guy named Linus Torvalds in 1991. He didn’t set out to write a clone of Unix he just wanted a program to connect to his remote modem. The little program grew until he realised that by replicating most of the C standard library - he was close to having a working clone of Unix.

As he gradually turned it into an operating system - he released it so other people could play with it. At that point, it didn’t have a name. But it was commonly knows as Linus’ Unix, which was later shorted to LinUx and the finally Linux. 

Linux is now the most widely used OS in the world. Used by most internet servers, Chrome OS laptop are built on top of the Linux kernel, and Android phones run Linux under the hood.
