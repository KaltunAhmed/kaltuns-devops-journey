## Commands & Shell

Commands are instructions you write into a terminal to perform specific tasks on your computer. They can be used to manipulate files, manage processes, configure settings, and interact with the operating system or installed software. Mastering basic commands is essential for effectively using the terminal.

## What is a Shell?

A **shell** is a command-line interpreter that processes and executes the commands entered by the user. It provides a way for users to interact with the operating system by typing commands. The shell also supports scripting, which allows users to automate tasks.

### Common Shells:
- **Bash (Bourne Again Shell)**: Default on many Linux distributions and macOS.
- **Zsh (Z Shell)**: Known for its advanced features and customizability.
- **Fish (Friendly Interactive Shell)**: Focuses on user-friendly design and interactive features.

## Key Differences Between Terminal and Shell

1. **Purpose**:
   - **Terminal**: Provides the interface and environment for interacting with the shell. It’s essentially a window or application.
   - **Shell**: Executes commands and provides functionality for command execution and scripting. It’s the program that runs inside the terminal.

2. **Role**:
   - **Terminal**: Acts as a conduit for user input and output. It displays what the shell outputs and captures user input.
   - **Shell**: Processes and executes the commands that you input.

3. **Examples**:
   - **Terminal**: Terminal applications like GNOME Terminal, macOS Terminal, and Windows Terminal.
   - **Shell**: Shells like Bash, Zsh, and Fish.
